## A lightweight and powerful minesweeper solver.
Uses the typical minesweeper strategy to solve a board of any given size.

Efficient, low complexity, and doubles as a fully playable game of minesweeper.


In my honest opinion, Minesweeper is one of the most entertaining retro games of all time, with just the right amount of luck, and some serious dopamine from quickly flagging large sets of mines. There are some very interesting strategies for pre-made puzzles I may add to this bot in the future, but this bot is powerful enough to solve the majority of standard to advanced puzzles.
